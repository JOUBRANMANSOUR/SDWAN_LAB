# v5 pre-implementation record

## Scope and preservation

- Working project root: `/mnt/data/sdwan-lab`; original inspected reference remains `/home/joubran/projects/sdwan-lab/sdwan_v4`.
- Preserved working reference: `/mnt/data/sdwan-lab/sdwan_v4` (a manifest-verified copy of the original).
- This project directory is not a Git worktree; phase commits are therefore not possible here.
- Required environments found without modification: `/home/joubran/containernet-venv38` and `/home/joubran/ryu-venv38`.
- Baseline manifest: `preservation/sdwan_v4.sha256` (all regular files in `sdwan_v4`, sorted by absolute path).
- Baseline verification command: `sha256sum -c sdwan_v5/preservation/sdwan_v4.sha256`.

The baseline was verified before v5 source was created. v5 tests include the same command as a preservation gate.

## v4 migration table

| v4 component | Current limitation | Reusable part | v5 replacement / status | Responsible v5 file |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `config/topology.yaml` | `home_hub` scalar; one interface per transport | Underlay names, addressing discipline, load split | Validated dual-hub/site inventory, egress and cloud schema | `config/topology.yaml`, `common/model.py` |
| Topology-generated WireGuard keys | Keys are generated around topology startup | Per-node command wiring only | Edge-local persisted keys, public-key registration and rotations | `identity_store.py`, `resource_allocator.py`, `edge_agent_v5.py` |
| `/run` edge identity | Ephemeral restart identity | None for private material | Mounted `/var/lib/sdwan/{identity,wireguard,state}` persistence | `identity_store.py`, Docker volumes |
| `/sdwan/register` | Requires every router public key in one request | Desired-state shape and idempotent reconcile concept | Independent hub/spoke enrollment and resume state machine | `ztp_service_v5.py`, `enrollment_state.py` |
| Trusted `--site` startup identity | Caller supplies trusted site identity | Containernet may name a container only | Generic bootstrap client maps authenticated UUID+claim to staged inventory | `ztp_client.py`, `device_inventory.py` |
| Shared `X-SDWAN-Token` auth | One token is not device identity or mTLS | Legacy migration boundary only | Claim bootstrap followed by CSR, CA-issued operational cert, mTLS | `identity_ca.py`, `ztp_service_v5.py`, `mtls.py` |
| Policy Service dictionaries/counters | Volatile policy, metrics, overrides and versions | SLA scoring remains metadata/policy input | SQLite-owned desired state, audit, overrides, leases and ownership | `persistence/policy_store.py`, `policy_service_v5.py` |
| Desired-state version | Version is in memory and is not attributable/durable | Canonical desired-state construction | Digest, schema, generations, acks, monotonic conflict rejection | `desired_state_v5.py`, `persistence/policy_store.py` |
| `active_hub` assignments | Cannot represent partial transport failure or ownership | 3/2 normal preference assignment | Preferred/standby, six target states, versioned prefix ownership | `route_ownership.py`, `route_resolver.py` |
| Hub failover ordering | Applies old hub before new hub and requires old-hub reachability | Reconcile/rollback intent | Surviving-hub/spoke prepare-commit and stale owner fencing | `policy_service_v5.py`, `route_ownership.py` |
| Edge cached state | In-memory state/route version; `/run` keys | Local route replacement and classifier supervision patterns | Persistent cache, queued events, restart reconciliation, local emergency mode | `edge_agent_v5.py`, `identity_store.py` |
| Ryu responsibilities | Some service coupling is still broad | OF 1.3 underlay and stats code | Strict OF underlay/telemetry boundary; no ZTP/DPI/route-owner role | `controller_v5.py` |
| nDPI/NFQUEUE data plane | Three transport paths; no egress/target-aware policy contract | Native C pre-encryption metadata and once-per-flow pinning | Docker native classifier remains metadata-only; Edge resolves healthy target | `classifier/`, `edge_agent_v5.py`, `common/marks.py` |

## Validation classification

| Test type | May run unprivileged | Requires privileged Ubuntu execution |
|---|---|---|
| Python unit tests, state machines, config validation, SQLite transactions/migrations with temporary DBs, CSR parsing with temporary keys, manifest verification, secret scans | Yes; use `source ~/ryu-venv38/bin/activate` for control-plane tests | No |
| Ryu import/controller unit tests | Yes; use `source ~/ryu-venv38/bin/activate` | OpenFlow datapath test needs Ryu plus OVS/Containernet |
| C source/static checks | Yes where compiler/development headers are present | Native nDPI build may require Docker or system library packages |
| Docker image build and container self-tests | Docker daemon access; no `sudo` if user is in docker group | Docker daemon if group access is absent |
| Topology creation, OVS, Containernet, network namespaces | No | `sudo`, `source ~/containernet-venv38/bin/activate`, Containernet and OVS |
| WireGuard peers/handshakes, policy routes, `ip rule`, `iptables`, NFQUEUE, conntrack, NAT, packet captures, failover, DC/SaaS/cloud traffic | No | `sudo`, Docker, WireGuard, iptables/NFQUEUE, Containernet/OVS |

No live networking result will be reported as passed until its Ubuntu privileged command has actually completed and saved evidence.
